    <strong class="number">1942</strong><br><br>  James Marshall Hendrix was born at Seattle’s King County Hospital. Jimi took an interest in music at a young age, strumming a broomstick like it was a guitar.<br><br>
    <strong class="number">1958</strong><br><br>  Jimis father (Al Hendrix) had purchased a five-dollar, second-hand acoustic guitar from one of his friends. Shortly thereafter, Jimi joined his first band, <b>The Velvetones</b>. That summer Al purchased Jimmy his first electric guitar, a Supro Ozark 1560S; Jimi then joined a band called <b>The Rocking Kings.</b><br><br> 
    <strong class="number">1961</strong><br><br>  Jimi left home to enlist in the United States Army. Soon after he earned the right to wear the “Screaming Eagles” patch for the paratroop division. While stationed at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, Jimmy formed <b>'The King Casuals'</b> with bassist Billy Cox. After being discharged due to an injury he received during a parachute jump, Jimmy began working as a session guitarist under the name Jimmy James. <br><br> 
    <strong class="number">1965</strong><br><br>  Jimi had played with several marquee acts, including Ike and Tina Turner, Sam Cooke, the Isley Brothers, and Little Richard. Jimi parted ways with Little Richard to form his own band, <b>Jimmy James and the Blue Flames</b>, shedding the role of back-line guitarist for the spotlight of lead guitar.<br><br> 
    <strong class="number">1966</strong><br><br> Jimi formed <b>'The Jimi Hendrix Experience'</b> featuring drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding. The Experience’s first single, “Hey Joe,” spent ten weeks on the UK charts, topping out at spot No. 6 in early 1967. <br>The debut single was quickly followed by the release of a full-length album <b>Are You Experienced</b>, a psychedelic musical compilation featuring anthems of a generation. <br> Are You Experienced has remained one of the most popular rock albums of all time, featuring tracks like “Purple Haze,” “The Wind Cries Mary,” “Foxey Lady,” “Fire,” and “Are You Experienced?<br><br>  
    <strong class="number">1967</strong><br><br>  Although Jimi experienced overwhelming success in Britain, it wasn’t until he returned to America in June 1967 that he ignited the crowd at the <b>Monterey International Pop Festival</b> with his incendiary performance of “Wild Thing.” Literally overnight, The Jimi Hendrix Experience became one of most popular and highest grossing touring acts in the world.<br><br>  
    <strong class="number">1968</strong><br><br> After the massive success of his first album, Jimi released <b>Axis: Bold As Love.</b> Back in America, Jimi Hendrix built his own recording studio, <b>Electric Lady Studios</b> in New York City. The name of this project became the basis for his most demanding musical release, a two LP collection, Electric Ladyland. Throughout 1968, the demands of touring and studio work took its toll on the group and in 1969 the Experience disbanded.<br><br>  
    <strong class="number">1969</strong><br><br> Jimi played the <b>Woodstock festival</b> in the summer of 1969, highlighted by the renegade version of “Star Spangled Banner,” which brought the mud-soaked audience to a frenzy.<br><br>  
    <strong class="number">1970</strong><br><br> As 1970 progressed, Jimi brought back drummer Mitch Mitchell to the group and together with Billy Cox on bass, this new trio once again formed The Jimi Hendrix Experience. In the studio, the group recorded several tracks for another two LP set, tentatively titled <b>First Rays Of The New Rising Sun</b>.<br><br> Unfortunately, Hendrix was unable to see this musical vision through to completion due to his hectic worldwide touring schedules, then tragic death on September 18, 1970. Fortunately, the recordings Hendrix slated for release on the album were finally issued through the support of his family and original studio engineer Eddie Kramer on the 1997 release First Rays Of The New Rising Sun.
